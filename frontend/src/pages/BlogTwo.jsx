      <h3>🪵 1. Wood-Tiled Walls: Bringing Nature Indoors</h3>
      <p>
        A far cry from basic wood panels, 2025 introduces tile-style wooden walls with grain textures, chevron patterns, or stacked layouts that mimic artisan cladding.
        These wood-tiled surfaces not only add visual warmth but also offer a calming organic vibe—perfect for NCR homes coping with urban chaos.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>🔸 <strong>Where to use it:</strong> TV backdrops, bedroom headboards, balcony walls, or entryways</li>
        <li>🔸 <strong>Popular tones:</strong> Natural oak, teak, walnut, and ash grey</li>
        <li>🔸 <strong>Best finishes:</strong> PU matte or textured laminate over MDF for durability</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Why it works in NCR homes:</strong> Wood adds warmth to concrete-heavy constructions and makes compact apartments feel grounded and inviting.

      <h3>🛠 2. Mixed Metals: Edgy Elegance</h3>
      <p>
        Gone are the days when chrome was your only option. Today’s NCR interiors flaunt a sophisticated mix of metal finishes—brushed brass, matte black, antique gold, and copper.
        These finishes add sleek, industrial flair to otherwise soft, modern spaces.
      </p>
      <p>🔸<strong>Where it shines:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>● Brass handles on dark kitchen cabinetry</li>
        <li>● Black metal pendant lights over wooden dining tables</li>
        <li>● Copper plumbing fixtures in minimalist bathrooms</li>
        <li>● Mixed metal art frames and hardware in entryways</li>
      </ul>
      <p>💡 <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Stick to 2–3 metal tones max per room to avoid visual chaos.</p>

      <h3>🧱 3. Tile Drenching: Bold & Cohesive Statements</h3>
      <p>
        Tile drenching—using a single tile color or material across multiple surfaces—is taking NCR bathrooms, kitchens, and even balconies by storm.
        Think floor-to-wall tile continuity in deep blue, emerald green, or soft blush, creating a spa-like luxury with minimal effort.
      </p>
      <p>🔸<strong>Where to try it:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>● Monochrome tiled powder rooms</li>
        <li>● Glossy backsplash + counter in same ceramic tone</li>
        <li>● Vertical and horizontal tiled walls for depth</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Trending materials:</strong> Glazed ceramics, subway tiles, handmade terracotta, Moroccan-style tiles
      </p>
      <p><strong>Why homeowners love it:</strong> It adds bold character and reflects light, especially useful in smaller spaces or dark corners.</p>

      <h3>🖼 How to Layer Colour and Texture Right</h3>
      <p>
        Combining materials and finishes may seem intimidating, but here’s a simple formula for success:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>1. Start Neutral: Choose a base material—wood or tile—that sets the tone.</li>
        <li>2. Add Metal Accents: Introduce 1–2 metal elements in handles, lights, or art.</li>
        <li>3. Use One Drenching Feature: A wall or floor drenched in tile or wood becomes the focal point.</li>
        <li>4. Balance with Soft Furnishings: Use linen, boucle, or jute to soften hard materials.</li>
      </ul>
